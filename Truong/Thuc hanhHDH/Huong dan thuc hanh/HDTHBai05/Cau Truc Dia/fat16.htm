<p align="center"><em><small>Updated : June 17th, 1999</small></em></p>

<p>Looking for FAT32 Info?&nbsp; Go <a href="http://www.teleport.com/%7Ebrainy/fat32.htm">here</a>.<br>
Looking for Informaton on how to Read and Write to your Hard Drive?&nbsp; Go <a href="http://www.teleport.com/%7Ebrainy/diskaccess.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p>I've written this page for anyone who wishes to write software that can do low-level
reading and writing of a hard drive, and needs to know what the underlying structure of a
FAT16 Drive is, in order to interpret the information properly.&nbsp; Basically I've
searched all over the web, and have compiled this information in one spot. &nbsp;&nbsp;
Hopefully it can be of use to someone.&nbsp; I don't guarantee that all of this
information is correct or complete, but so far is seems to have been working for me.
&nbsp;</p>

<p>A lot of the number references I've made in this document are in Hexadecimal.&nbsp; Any
that are have an 'h' after them.&nbsp; Also, just in case my terminology may be different
from yours; a 'WORD' is 2 Bytes and a 'DOUBLE WORD' is 4 Bytes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Master Boot Record</strong></u></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Master Boot Record is the same for pretty much all Operating Systems.&nbsp; It is
  located on the first Sector of the Hard Drive, at Cylinder 0, Head 0, Sector 1.&nbsp; It
  is the first piece of code that your computer runs after it has checked all of your
  hardware (POST) and turned control of loading software over the hard drive.&nbsp; It also
  contains the partition table, which defines the different sections of your hard
  drive.&nbsp; Basically if anything happens to this little 512 byte section, your hard
  drive is brain dead.&nbsp; Kinda scary, eh? :)</p>

<strong>Cylinder/Sector Encoding</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I guess back in the days of 10MB hard drives and 8086's, code was at a premium. &nbsp;
  So they did everything they could to preserve space.&nbsp; Unfortunately now we have to
  live with it, but luckily they created new ways of translating the system so the 1024
  Cylinder Limit (2^10) isn't too big of a problem, for newer computers, at least. &nbsp;
  Older ones usually need some sort of Disk Overlay program to make them see the whole hard
  drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Anyway, to get the Sector out of this, you need to apply an AND mask ($3F) to it.
  &nbsp; To get the Cylinder, you take the high byte and OR it with the low byte that has
  been AND masked with ($C0) and then Shifted Left Two.&nbsp; It's not very easy to explain,
  so I'll just show you how I did it with two routines I made (In Pascal) for Encoding and
  Decoding the Cylinder/Sector.&nbsp; Hopefully even if you don't know Pascal you'll be able
  to read it.</p>
  <p>Function CylSecEncode(Cylinder, Sector : Word) : Word;<br>
  Begin<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CylSecEncode := (Lo(Cylinder) shl 8) or (Hi(Cylinder) shl 6) or Sector;<br>
  End;<br>
  <br>
  Procedure CylSecDecode(Var Cylinder, Sector : Word; CylSec : Word);<br>
  Begin<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cylinder := Hi(CylSec) or ((Lo(CylSec) and $C0) shl 2);<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sector := (CylSec and $3F);<br>
  End;<br>

<u><strong>Reading Multiple Partitions</strong></u></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since FAT16 is limited to 2GB per partition, drives that use it tend to have multiple
  partitions.&nbsp; The first partition is the Primary Partition, and everything else is
  stored in the Extended Partition.&nbsp; It's a little tricky when it comes to reading
  those extra partitions though (not a lot, just a little).&nbsp; The first record in the
  partition table shows where the Primary partition is (how big it is, where it starts, and
  where it ends).&nbsp; The second entry in the partition table shows where the Entire
  Extended Partition is (which may include more than just one partition).&nbsp; To read any
  more partitions, you go to the where it says the Extended Partition starts, and read the
  first sector.&nbsp; It acts just like the MBR.&nbsp; It'll have blank where the code is
  supposed to be, and in the partition table it will have for it's first entry the next
  Partition in the Drive, and if there are anymore, there will be another Extended
  partition, just like before.&nbsp; However, all references to Sector Numbers are made
  using the that new MBR point as the reference, making it a virtual drive.&nbsp; Just
  incase this doesn't make much sense (and by the way I explain things I can understand if
  it doesn't), let me show you how a drive with three partitions is setup.</p>
  <p>MBR of Whole Drive</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Entry #1 - Points to Partition #1<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Entry #2 - Points to the Entire Extended Partition</p>
  <p>You would read the first sector of that Extended Partition, and see another MBR
  Structure.</p>
  <p>MBR of Extended Partition</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Entry #1 - Points to Partition #2<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Entry #2 - Points to Rest of Extended Partition after Partition #2</p>
  <p>Now, all references to Sector Numbers (most specifically the entry at Offset 08h) in
  those Entries wouldn't be referenced from the start of the drive, but from the start of
  the Extended Partition.&nbsp; However, the CHS (Cylinder, Head, Sector) numbers would
  still be right.</p>
  <p>Once again, you would read the first sector of that Extended Partition, and see the
  next MBR.</p>
  <p>MBR of Rest of Extended Partition</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Entry #1 - Points to Partition #3<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No Entry #2, since this was the Last Partition</p>
  <p>If there were another partition, the pattern would continue just like before, until the
  last one was reached.</p>

  whether or not that cluster has data in it, and if so, if it is the end of the data or
  there is another cluster after it.&nbsp; All Data on a Partition starts with Cluster #2
  (Right after Root Directory). &nbsp;&nbsp; If the FAT Entry is 0, then there is no data in
